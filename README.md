# Text generation with VAE's
In this repository is a collection of models trained on a toy dataset and the twitter dataset (a character model in this case). 

The following models are provided:
* RNN VAE
* CNN VAE
* Hybrid VAE
* Ladder VAE
* Ladder CNN VAE

Also the first three models come both with either a dense latent space or a feature map latent space.
